Catching the Reading Bug

I have never been a fan of new year's resolution. Couple of years back I was curious about new year's resolution people make. I read an article about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg's new year resolution for 2015 that caught my attention. It was to read a book every other week. I decided to make this a resolution for 2017. Mine was to read one book a month and I haven't looked back since then.
The next task was to figure out what books to read. I didn't have to go too far for that. My wife is an avid reader so I decided to start from her collection. Another good source for me was recommendations from my sister in law and her husband. I was feeling good as I started on this journey. A few months in to this goal I came across Bill Gates' summer reading list and it gave me a few more books to add to my collection.
It has been 2.5 years since I started on this reading journey. I have read a lot of non-fiction books on varying topics since then and have helped me grow as a person. In the next few posts I will share the books I have read and what I loved about them. I am looking forward to continuing my book reading journey and expanding my horizons over the next phase of my life. Here are some of the books that I will talk about over the next few posts - "Legacy:Letters from Eminent Parents to Their Daughters", "The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Building a Business When There are No Easy Answers" and "The Growth Mindset - Carol S. Dweck".
